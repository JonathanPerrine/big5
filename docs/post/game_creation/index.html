<h2 id="where-to-begin">Where to begin?</h2>

<p>Rangers don’t just fight - They fight for something. For most rangers, this is the Park - A game preserve, national park, or other wilderness area set aside to remain free from resource exploitation, construction, and usually human habitation.</p>

<h3 id="big-issues">Big Issues</h3>

<p>Create two Big Issues (Current or pending threats that could harm the park) and attach aspects to them. Parks are threatened by Big Issues - local unrest (Calls for Modernization,) rebel armies (Steel Monsoon Guerillas,) corrupt officials (Sell-Out Governor Akimbo), greedy corporations (Green Moss Mining Inc) and, of course, poachers (The Hyena, World-Famous Murderer). These threats have been slowed briefly by the appearance of ‘civilian’ aniform drones, but ever more advanced technology, determined foes,  and powerful patrons are quickly evening the fight again.</p>

<h3 id="the-park">The Park</h3>

<p>You will also need to establish at least one location - The Park. It should have two aspects. The Organization describes the backers and support, close or distant, of the park itself (Global Grasslands Collective, State Wildllife Board). The Community is the local population and their interactions with the park. (Lion-worshipping traditional village, Electricity-hungry suburban sprawl)</p>

<h3 id="faces">Faces</h3>

<p>Lastly, add at least two Faces. Round out these Big Issues, The Organization, and The Community with characters whose names will be recognized around the park. Dangerous poachers, corrupt park managers, distant folk-medicine fanatics, and locals pressured by big companies or rebel cells all make great faces. If a notable location such as a local village or nearby city comes up, you can add them (with an aspect) as well.</p>
