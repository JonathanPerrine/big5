<h2 id="in-the-late-21st-century-the-natural-resources-we-once-took-for-granted-are-under-threat">In the late 21st century, the natural resources we once took for granted are under threat.</h2>

<p><strong>Poachers</strong> hunt exotic wildlife as folk-cures and pharmaceutical research drives demand for their bodies. <strong>Terrorists, rebels, and freedom fighters alike</strong> sell animal parts from ever-dwindling wild populations to fill their war chests. <strong>Corporations</strong> spend millions in search of billions buried beneath protected wildlife zones. <strong>Struggling locals</strong> put a quick buck over the survival of their wildlife and land. <strong>Corrupt officials</strong> wheel and deal with the parks they supposedly protect as collateral and favors.</p>

<p>With each passing year, the tech used to threaten the parks advances. <em>And so does the tech to defend it.</em></p>

<p><strong>UAVs and military-grade weapons</strong> have skimmed over and shot through forest, jungle and savannah for most of the century. They are joined by a more versatile tool adapted fresh from the modern battlefield - <strong>Aniform Drones</strong>. Mimicking the animals now under dire threat, resourceful communities, concerned NGOs and wealthy donors are putting these animal-like machines into service protecting their biological counterparts. But while synthetic guardians watch over the <strong>herds, packs, prides and charges</strong> they (almost) blend into, rangers are not the only ones upgrading. <strong>New tools require new experts</strong>, and maintaining and working alongside these chrome creatures has required a new breed of <strong>Park Rangers</strong>.</p>
