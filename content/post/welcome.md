## In the late 21st century, the natural resources we once took for granted are under threat.
 **Poachers** hunt exotic wildlife as folk-cures and pharmaceutical research drives demand for their bodies. **Terrorists, rebels, and freedom fighters alike** sell animal parts from ever-dwindling wild populations to fill their war chests. **Corporations** spend millions in search of billions buried beneath protected wildlife zones. **Struggling locals** put a quick buck over the survival of their wildlife and land. **Corrupt officials** wheel and deal with the parks they supposedly protect as collateral and favors.

With each passing year, the tech used to threaten the parks advances. _And so does the tech to defend it._


**UAVs and military-grade weapons** have skimmed over and shot through forest, jungle and savannah for most of the century. They are joined by a more versatile tool adapted fresh from the modern battlefield - **Aniform Drones**. Mimicking the animals now under dire threat, resourceful communities, concerned NGOs and wealthy donors are putting these animal-like machines into service protecting their biological counterparts. But while synthetic guardians watch over the **herds, packs, prides and charges** they (almost) blend into, rangers are not the only ones upgrading. **New tools require new experts**, and maintaining and working alongside these chrome creatures has required a new breed of **Park Rangers**.
